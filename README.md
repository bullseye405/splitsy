# Splitsy: Simple Expense Splitter

## Why Splitsy Exists

Splitsy is inspired by many popular expense splitting apps that require subscriptions or charge fees for premium features. This project was created to tackle those limitations and provide a free, open alternative—mainly for personal use. If you’re tired of paywalls and required accounts just to split expenses with friends, Splitsy is for you.

Splitsy is not a commercial product and does not aim to compete for profit. It’s a personal project, built to make expense splitting simple and accessible for everyone.
